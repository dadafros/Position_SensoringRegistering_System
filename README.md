# Position_SensoringRegistering_System
This is my project at Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG) developed in an academic fair as electronics technician.

The project is executed in a MSP430 microcontroller and developed in IAR IDE.
The idea is to read position data from an encoder used in head printers in order to improve measurings in a old mechanical testing machine of CEFET-MG.
The counts of the encoders are transformed and printed in a 16X2 LCD Display and a graphic of the position versus time is plotted in a computer through USB port using LABView.
